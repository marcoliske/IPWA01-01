## How To run the App

1. Install Node.js:
Basically Node.js contains the Node Package Manager (npm). That is what we will need to install all dependencies.

2. Install GIT:
GIT Bash or the GIT GUI is necessary

3. Clone the repository

4. Install npm Packages:
After navigating into the project root directory, run '$ npm install' to install the project dependencies

5. Open the project in a browser:
Run 'npm start' for a dev server. Navigate to 'localhost:3000'. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Note

Developed and tested with Chromium Browser and Node.js version 16.20.2
